StageFright is a hard rock band from Vorarlberg, Austria, founded in 2018. After several line-up changes, the current five-piece constellation of singer Andy, rhythm guitarist Ace, lead guitarist Skip, bassist Brandon and drummer Wolf was formed.
In the following years, StageFright performed at numerous major events and concerts such as Szene Open Air 2019. Since the band's inception, StageFright has been playing live shows non-stop.
In the summer of 2021, the band began recording their debut album "Wanted" at Nautilus Sound Studios.  The album, named after the title track, consists of 12 numbers in total and can be described as a classic hard rock work with various elements of modern metal and will be released later this year.
